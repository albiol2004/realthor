# Bugs to Fix

1. When creating or updating a contact, some fields require filling up even if they are not related. For example if I select Category: Buyer, it wont let me update until I fill budget and stage and everything. Also, maybe we should get rid of the Potential Buyer/Seller thing, just by combining the Stage and Category should be enough. And in the crm page filters we can change those to Leads, Clients, Buyers, Sellers... etc
