1. Uploading documents, AI labeling polls to refresh but OCR doesnt poll to show AI-labeling loading sign then, it stays at processing. I want to replicate the functionality of the loading while waiting for AI-labeling.
2. AI cant relate my ID to me, I have created 2 contacts with my name but different metadata to try and in one test it related correctly being an insurance policy with my full address on it. But it doesnt seem to be able to do it with Passports and IDs. Apart from this seems to work just fine. (THIS ONE HAS BEEN IMPROVED BUT THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AS IT IS FAILING IN SOME CASES WHAT CAN WE DO?)
