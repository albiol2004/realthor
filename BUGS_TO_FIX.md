1. Uploading documents, AI labeling polls to refresh but OCR doesnt poll to show AI-labeling loading sign then, it stays at processing.
2. AI cant relate my ID to me, I have created 2 contacts with my name but different metadata to try and in one test it related correctly being an insurance policy with my full address on it. But it doesnt seem to be able to do it with Passports and IDs. I think we could add place and date of birth in our Contacts data in Supabase and in the frontend and include it in the metadata shown to AI to improve this. Apart from this seems to work just fine.
