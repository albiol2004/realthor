### PIPELINE 1: Residential Resale (Second Hand)

*The most common transaction. High risk of hidden debts and physical defects.*

#### 1. CRITICAL (The "Deal Killers")

* **IDENTIFICATION:** DNI/NIE/Passport of all owners. If signing via **Power of Attorney**, the original copy is mandatory at the Notary.
* **AML (BLANQUEO):** KYC Form + **Proof of Funds** (The Buyer must show the origin of the money; the Agent must keep this on file).
* **DEEDS:** Original **Title Deed** (Escritura) to verify ownership.
* **NOTA SIMPLE:** Must be recent (<3 months). Crucial to see if the property has a mortgage or is seized (embargo).
* **CERTIFICATES:**
  * **CEE (Energy):** Mandatory for the listing.
  * **Community Debt Certificate:** The buyer cannot sign at the Notary without this unless they expressly waive it (high risk).
  * **Habitability (Cédula):** **MANDATORY** in Catalonia, Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, Navarre, Murcia. Without it, the Notary will not sign, and utilities cannot be changed.
  * **Seguro Decenal:** *Only if the property is <10 years old.*
* **TAX:** **IBI Receipt**. The Notary needs the catastrophic reference and proof it’s paid up to date.
* **CONTRACTS:** **Sales Listing Agreement (Nota de Encargo)**.

#### 2. LEGALLY RECOMMENDED (The "Safety Net")

* **LEGAL/URBAN:** **Certificate of No Urban Infraction**. *Vital for Villas/Chalets.* If the pool or garage was built illegally, the Town Hall could fine the new owner.
* **CONTRACTS:** **Arras Contract**. Essential to secure the price and penalize backing out.
* **TECHNICAL:** **ITE (Technical Building Inspection)**. Mandatory for buildings >45-50 years (varies by municipality). Banks often deny mortgages if the building failed the ITE.
* **UTILITIES:** **Electrical Bulletin (CIE)**. If the installation is >20 years old, the utility company will demand a new bulletin to change the name on the bill.
* **TAX:** **Plusvalía Estimate**. Seller needs to know this cost; Buyer ensures it's paid to avoid liens.

#### 3. ADVISED (Due Diligence)

* **COMMUNITY:** Meeting Minutes (Actas) for the last 2 years. (Look for "Derramas" - upcoming expensive repairs).
* **PLANS:** Floor plans.
* **UTILITIES:** Last 3 months of bills.

### PIPELINE 2: New Development (Obra Nueva)

*Buying from a Developer. The compliance burden shifts to the building's legality.*

#### 1. CRITICAL (The "Deal Killers")

* **IDENTIFICATION:** DNI/NIE/Passport.
* **AML (BLANQUEO):** Strict KYC + Proof of Funds (Developers are audited heavily).
* **CONTRACTS:** **Reservation Contract** & **Purchase Contract** (Private).
* **NEW BUILD SPECIFICS:**
  * **Licencia de Primera Ocupación (LPO):** Replaces the "Cédula" in new builds. Without this, you cannot legally live there or get water/electricity.
  * **Seguro Decenal:** The 10-year structural insurance policy proof.
  * **Libro del Edificio:** The "User Manual" for the building (blueprints, materials used).
  * **Bank Guarantee (Aval Bancario):** *Crucial addition.* The law requires the developer to guarantee the buyer's deposit if the building isn't finished.

#### 2. LEGALLY RECOMMENDED

* **PLANS:** Stamped architectural plans attached to the contract.
* **MEMORIA DE CALIDADES:** The binding list of materials (flooring, appliances) to ensure they deliver what was promised.

#### 3. ADVISED

* **PROGRESS REPORTS:** Photos/Certifications of construction stages.

---

### PIPELINE 3: Residential Rentals (Alquiler LAU)

*Compliance focuses on "Tenant Solvency" and "Property Habitability."*

#### 1. CRITICAL (The "Deal Killers")

* **IDENTIFICATION:** DNI/NIE/Passport.
* **CONTRACTS:** **Listing Agreement** (Authorizing agent to rent it).
* **CERTIFICATES:**
  * **CEE (Energy):** Legally required to give a copy to the tenant.
  * **Habitability (Cédula):** Required to prove it's a legal dwelling (vital for the tenant to get "Empadronamiento").
* **RENTAL CONTRACT:** Must adhere to the LAU (Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos).

#### 2. LEGALLY RECOMMENDED

* **RENTALS (SOLVENCY):**
  * **Payslips (Nóminas) / Tax Returns.**
  * **Rent Default Insurance (Seguro de Impago):** Highly recommended. This insurance company acts as a second "Risk Filter."
* **INVENTORY:** A photo-documented annex to the contract to protect the deposit.

#### 3. ADVISED

* **UTILITIES:** Last invoices (to show the tenant expected costs).
* **COMMUNITY STATUTES:** To check if pets or specific activities are banned.

---

### PIPELINE 4: Commercial & Retail (Locales & Traspasos)

*Business-to-Business. Focus on "Activity Licenses."*

#### 1. CRITICAL (The "Deal Killers")

* **IDENTIFICATION:** Company Deeds (Escritura de Constitución), CIF, and Administrator's ID.
* **DEEDS:** Title Deed / Nota Simple.
* **CERTIFICATES:**
  * **Community Certificate:** Commercial units often have high community fees.
  * **CEE (Energy):** Yes, still required for sale/rent of offices/shops.
* **TAX:** IBI Receipt.
* **CONTRACTS:** **Listing Agreement**.

#### 2. LEGALLY RECOMMENDED

* **LEGAL/URBAN:** **Urban Compatibility Certificate**. Before buying a bar, ensure the Town Hall *allows* a bar at that address.
* **LICENSE STATUS:** If it's a "Traspaso" (transfer), the **Opening License (Licencia de Apertura)** must be valid and transferable.
* **UTILITIES:** **Electrical Bulletin (CIE)**. Commercial power needs are higher; old installations often fail inspection.

#### 3. ADVISED

* **TECHNICAL:** Acoustic/Soundproofing audit (for bars/restaurants).

---

### PIPELINE 5: Rural & Land (Rustica / Terrenos)

*The Wild West. The biggest risk is boundary disputes and illegal builds.*

#### 1. CRITICAL (The "Deal Killers")

* **DEEDS & NOTA SIMPLE:** *Warning:* In rural Spain, the deed description often does not match reality.
* **IDENTIFICATION:** DNI/NIE.
* **CONTRACTS:** Listing Agreement.
* **TAX:** IBI Receipt (Polígono/Parcela numbers must match).

#### 2. LEGALLY RECOMMENDED

* **LEGAL/URBAN:** **Cédula Urbanística**. A document from the Town Hall stating exactly what can be built (or NOT built) on that land.
* **TECHNICAL:** **Topographic Survey (Georreferenciación)**. *Vital.* The Cadastre map is often wrong. You need a topographer to define the exact GPS coordinates of the borders to register it correctly at the Property Registry.
* **LEGAL/URBAN:** **Certificate of No Infraction**. Essential if there is a small house/shed on the land.

#### 3. ADVISED

* **WATER RIGHTS:** Documents proving ownership of water wells or irrigation rights (crucial for value).

### SUMMARY OF "THE DEAL KILLERS"

If you are building a checklist system, these are the **Hard Stops** where the software should block the agent from proceeding:

1. **No Nota de Encargo?** $\rightarrow$ STOP. You are working for free/illegally.
2. **No CEE (Energy Cert)?** $\rightarrow$ STOP. You cannot publish on Idealista/Portals (Law 8/2013).
3. **No Cédula (in Catalonia/etc)?** $\rightarrow$ STOP. Notary will reject the sale.
4. **No KYC/Proof of Funds?** $\rightarrow$ STOP. You are violating Anti-Money Laundering laws (severe fines).
5. **No Community Certificate?** $\rightarrow$ STOP. Notary will not sign the deed.
