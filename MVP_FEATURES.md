### MVP Scope (Launch-ready in 3-6 months)

## 1. Home Page (100% in MVP – this is the “daily cockpit”)

# Action Center (AI-prioritized task list)
# Talk to Kairo command bar (natural language → actions)
# Agent Notepad → auto-tasks/reminders
# Real-time sync to other pages

Why? This is where agents spend 80% of their time. If this page alone saves them 1-2 hours/day, they’ll pay for it.

## 2. CRM Page (core features only)

# Contact List + search
# Unified Messages (Email + SMS + WhatsApp – at least 2 of 3)
# Timeline (auto-logged calls/texts/emails)
# Deals Section (simple pipeline stages: Lead → Showing → Offer → Under Contract → Closed)
# Quick Actions (call/text/email buttons)
# AI-suggested follow-up messages (1-click send)

Skip for MVP: Preferences, tags, source tracking (can be added later).

## 3. Property Workspace (stripped to essentials)

# One property = one workspace
# Buyers Tab → “Match from CRM” (shows top 3-5 buyers with one-click message)
# Offers Tab → create basic offer (price, contingencies, deadlines) + export PDF
# Deadlines Tab (simple calendar view)
# Docs Tab (drag-and-drop upload, basic list)

Skip for MVP: Full CMA tool, Negotiation thread versions, AI valuation.

## 4. Compliance Page (basic but magical)

# Per-deal checklist (5-8 must-have docs: ID, pre-approval, contract, etc.)
# Document uploader + auto-reminders to client via email/SMS
# “Missing docs” banner on Home Page and Deal view
# Compliance % bar

Why include? Compliance stress is universal. If Kairo auto-chases documents, agents will love it instantly.

## 5. Social Page (lead capture only – don’t overbuild)

# Connect Instagram + Facebook (via Meta API)
# Lead Stream (all new DMs/comments in one feed)
# Auto-response (“Thanks! Are you looking to buy or sell?”)
# One-click “Qualify” → asks 3 questions (budget, timeline, area)
# Serious leads → auto-create CRM contact + tag “Hot Lead” + notify agent

Skip for MVP: Website forms, full qualification bot, spam filter.

## 6. Client Portal (light version – huge differentiator)

# Deal progress bar (same stages as agent sees)
# Document upload (drag-and-drop for clients)
# Simple chat with agent
# Deadline reminders via email/SMS

Skip for MVP: Payment center, Fair Price Meter, full AI assistant for clients.
